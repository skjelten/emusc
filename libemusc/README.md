# libEmuSC

## Status

libEmuSC is currently able to read most versions of the ROM files used by the SC-55 family of synths to reproduce similar audio output. There are however some significant refinements missing, such as proper pitch and TVF envelopes. See [current status](https://github.com/skjelten/emusc/wiki/Status) page in the wiki for more information.

Note that this project is in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Roland Corp.


## Dependencies

libEmuSC only depends on C++11 with threads and CMake, and should be portable to almost any system. See [the wiki](https://github.com/skjelten/emusc/wiki/Build-Instructions) for detailed build instructions.


## License

libEmuSC is released under the LGPL 3+ license.
