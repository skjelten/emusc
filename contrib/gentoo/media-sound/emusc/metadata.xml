	EmuSC is a software synthesizer that aims to emulate the Roland Sound Canvas SC-55 lineup to recreate
	the original sounds of these '90s era synthesizers. Emulation is done by extracting relevant information
	from the original control and PCM ROMs and reimplement the synth's behavior in modern C++.

	This project has been in development since 2022 and is currently able to reproduce audio that is relatively
	similar to the original synths. There are still some significant shortcomings in the generated audio,
	varying on which instruments and settings are being used, but the goal is to be able to reproduce sounds
	that will make it very difficult to notice the difference.

	If you are looking for the best possible SC-55 emulation today you might want to try
	<pkg>media-sound/nuked-sc55</pkg>, or to use a sound font based on the SC-55, such as SC-55 sound font
	made by Kitrinx and NewRisingSun.

	The EmuSC project is split into two parts:

		<pkg>media-sound/emusc</pkg>: A desktop application that serves as a frontend to libEmuSC.
		<pkg>media-sound/libemusc</pkg>: A library that implements all the Sound Canvas emulation.

	Note that this project is in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Roland Corp.
